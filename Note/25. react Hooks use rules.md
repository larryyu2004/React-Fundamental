# react Hooks use rules

1. use Hooks out of the component -> wrong
```Javascript
import { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect } from "react"

useState('')

function App() { 

  return (
    <div>

    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```
- Line 3:1:  React Hook "useState" cannot be called at the top level. React Hooks must be called in a React function component or a custom React Hook function  react-hooks/rules-of-hooks
2. use Hooks in the if and for statement
```Javascript
import { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect } from "react"

//useState('')

function App() { 
  if(Math.random() > 0.5){
    useState('')
  }
  return (
    <div>

    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```
-   Line 7:5:  React Hook "useState" is called conditionally. React Hooks must be called in the exact same order in every component render  react-hooks/rules-of-hooks
